## The Explore Page

This is the first page displayed in the app when opened, from here you can scroll through a list of recipes which can be clicked on to view the recipe. This page pulls recipes in from our database 30 at a time using pagination. The recipes in our MongoDB database were scraped from [publicdomainrecipes.org](https://publicdomainrecipes.org/)
